## Transmission Line Calculator
Find values of voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), reflection coefficient (ρ), return loss (RL). Extreme cases were considered. Refer to the relationship table below. This CLI program is written in Python. A GUI version is being considered for Windows and GNU/Linux with more implemented features if time permits.

I am aware of the ranges of VSWR, ρ, and RL. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/BradleyHo/ee140/issues/1) and I will commit changes after final exams. Also, I understand that ∞ is not a number. For all intents and purposes, ∞ represents a large number. If you're an EE major, you know how useful the concept of ∞ is.

| Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) | Reflection Coefficient (ρ = \|Γ\|) | Return Loss (RL) | Impedance Matching |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.0 | 0 | ∞ dB | Perfectly matched impedance |
| 1.1 | 0.0476 | 26 dB | Good impedance matching |
| 1.5 | 0.2 | 14 dB | Average impedance matching |
| 2.0 | 0.33 | 9.5 dB | Poor impedance matching |
| ∞ | 1 | 0 dB | Open circuit or short circuit |

## Greek Alphabet

The Greek alphabet is used along with other alphabet systems such as the English alphabet in mathematics, science, and engineering discisplines. There are many ways to pronounce the Greek alphabet letters. Even in American English, there may be multiple accepted pronunciations for certain letters. Whatever floats your boat. 😊


| Greek Letter Name | Uppercase Letter | Lowercase Letter | American English Pronunciation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Alpha | Α | α | /ˈælfə/ (AL fuh) |
| Beta | Β | β | /ˈbeɪtə/ (BAY tuh) |
| Gamma | Γ | γ | /ˈɡæmə/ (GAM uh) |
| Delta | Δ | δ | /ˈdɛltə/ (DELL tuh) |
| Epsilon | Ε | ε | /ˈɛpsɨlɒn/ (EP suh lon) |
| Zeta | Ζ | ζ | /ˈzeɪtə/ (ZAY tuh) |
| Eta | Η | η | /ˈeɪtə/ (AY tuh) |
| Theta | Θ | θ | /ˈθeɪtə/ (THAY tuh) |
| Iota | Ι | ι | /aɪˈoʊtə/ (eye OH tuh) |
| Kappa | Κ | κ | /ˈkæpə/ (CAP uh) |
| Lambda | Λ | λ | /ˈlæmdə/ (LAM duh) |
| Mu | Μ | μ | /ˈmjuː/, /ˈmuː/ (MYOO, MOO) |
| Nu | Ν | ν | /ˈnuː/ (NOO) |
| Xi | Ξ | ξ | /ˈzaɪ/, /ˈksaɪ/ (ZIGH, KS EYE, KSEE) |
| Omicron | Ο | ο | /ˈɒmɨkrɒn/ (AH mih cron, OH mih cron) |
| Pi | Π | π | /ˈpaɪ/ (PIE) |
| Rho | Ρ | ρ | /ˈroʊ/ (ROE) |
| Sigma | Σ | σ | /ˈsɪɡmə/ (SIG muh) |
| Tau | Τ | τ | /ˈtaʊ/, /ˈtɔː/ (TOW rhyming with COW, TAW rhyming with LAW) |
| Upsilon | Υ | υ | /ˈʌpsɨlɒn/ (UP suh lon) |
| Phi | Φ | φ | /ˈfaɪ/, /ˈfiː/ (FIE, FEE) |
| Chi | Χ | χ | /ˈkaɪ/ (KIGH, KEE) |
| Psi | Ψ | ψ | /ˈsaɪ/, /ˈpsaɪ/, /ˈsiː/ (SIGH, PSIGH, PSEE) |
| Omega | Ω | ω | /oʊˈmeɪɡə/ (oh MAY guh) |

Sigma also has another lowercase letter ς for word-final position which is rarely used as a symbol for STEM purposes as compared to σ.
