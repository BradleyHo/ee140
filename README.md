Programs that I created that are useful for EE 140 at SJSU.

Transmission Line Calculator: Find values of voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), reflection coefficient (œÅ), return loss (RL). This CLI program is written in Python. A GUI version is being considered for Windows and GNU/Linux with more implemented features if time permits.
